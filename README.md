For this one, just a simple example where users can choose one of their databases and see tables in it.

### Prerequisites

Use this template repository to a new Github repository in WildCodeSchool organization following this exemple :
`<campus>-<langage>-<YYMM>-<type>-<name>` as **bordeaux-php-1903-project2-servyy**

### Check on Travis

1. Go on [https://travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com).

## Steps

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Create *config/db.php* from *config/db.php.dist* file and add your DB parameters. Don't delete the *.dist* file, it must be kept.
```php
define('APP_DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
define('APP_DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('APP_DB_USER', 'your_db_user_wich_is_not_root');
define('APP_DB_PWD', 'your_db_password');
```
4. Import `simple-mvc.sql` in your SQL server,
5. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
6. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
7. From this starter kit, create your own web application.

### Windows Users

If you develop on Windows, you should edit you git configuration to change your end of line rules with this command :

`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

## URLs availables

* Home page at [localhost:8000/](localhost:8000/)
* Items list at [localhost:8000/item/index](localhost:8000/item/index)
* Item details [localhost:8000/item/index/show/:id](localhost:8000/item/show/2)
